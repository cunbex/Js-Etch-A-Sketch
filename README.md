# Non responsive Etch-A-Sketch by Odin project

In this project, i'll be creating a pretty neat toy. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#assignment Assignment, with personal layout.

media screen page was made on: 1600x900 laptop screen.

ps: this is not an advanced javascript project, this project was done in order to understand the basics of DOM manipulation and basics javascript conditions.
